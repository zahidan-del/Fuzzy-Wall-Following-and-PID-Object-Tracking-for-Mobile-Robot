Fuzzy Wall-Following and PID Object Tracking on Mobile Robot
This repository contains a mobile robot project with a hybrid control system combining a Fuzzy Logic Controller for wall-following navigation and a PID Controller for camera-based object tracking. The system uses a distributed architecture where the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B handles image processing and PID computation, while the ESP32 Devkit V1 controls the actuators in real-time based on fuzzy logic and commands from the Raspberry Pi.

Key Features
Wall-following navigation using Fuzzy Logic Controller based on VL53L0X distance sensor.

Camera-based object tracking using PID Controller.

Raspberry Pi integration for computer vision and ESP32 for motor control.

Multi-tasking system capable of performing navigation and object tracking simultaneously.

Object detection based on HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) for high accuracy under various lighting conditions.

Technologies Used
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B â€“ Computer vision processing and PID computation.

ESP32 Devkit V1 â€“ Real-time actuator control and fuzzy logic execution.

Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) â€“ Handles uncertainty and non-linearity in robot navigation.

PID Controller â€“ Adjusts robotâ€™s speed and direction during object tracking.

OpenCV (Python) â€“ HSV-based object detection from Raspberry Pi camera.

Serial Communication (UART) â€“ Connects Raspberry Pi with ESP32.
